You are in 'detached HEAD' state. You can look around, make experimental
changes and commit them, and you can discard any commits you make in this
state without impacting any branches by performing another checkout.

do so (now or later) by using -b with the checkout command again. Example:

  git checkout -b <new-branch-name>
